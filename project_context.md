Hi Kevin,

Well done on making it to the next stage of our process. We are really excited to have you learn more about Foundry and prepare for a work sample test. We recognize that completing this work is a lot just to get into the interviewing phase. Here at Rangr Data we specialize in Palantir Foundry, getting hands on work within the platform will let you know if it's something you want to pursue and gives us a look into how well you are able to adapt to the new tooling. We appreciate all the effort you are putting in! 
 
Our process generally follows the following steps:
Initial Screening Test: a quick multiple-choice set of questions to test your thinking [20 to 30 minutes]
Work Sample Test: a chance for you to demonstrate your skills with a real problem, typically using Palantir Foundry, adapted to the role you are applying for.
Interview(s): we ask you relevant questions and you get to ask us important questions, to see if there is a good fit
 
You are now on Step 2. In this step, we want to assess your ability to use Palantir Foundry to solve real-world problems.
 
In this step, we expect the following:
For you to familiarize yourself with Foundry and how it works
To complete some of the learning courses
To develop a CRM application with the datasets attached.
 
All the details you need are below. In a separate email, to follow within the next 24 hours, you will receive login instructions.
 
We expect you to complete this stage at your own pace, but at a maximum of 1 month of from receiving this email.
 
Once you are ready to present your CRM Application, please head over to the Candidate Portal and submit for review!
 
We really look forward to seeing your work. Good luck!

Work Sample Test: Build a CRM Solution (Customer Relationship Management)
A CRM is a tool to help sales people manage their interactions with customers. It typically stores all the information related to customers, people, leads and opportunities. Examples of well-known CRMS are Salesforce, Pipedrive, SugarCRM among others.
 
We would like you to create a CRM application. Use your own initiative and research to decide what capabilities it should offer. Then go ahead and build the application in the Foundry Sandbox. 
 
We would like you to use the two datasets attached as a basis for the company and person objects.
 
Our goal is to understand whether you can translate a need into an application. We are not looking for perfection, but rather for effectiveness in solving for the need.
 
This CRM app should enable users to interact meaningfully with their data by leveraging native Foundry concepts such as actions and links. Visualization may be a bonus, but robust functionality and clear use-case insights are absolutely essential.
 
During your presentation of your solution, we will ask you to show us the application for about 5 minutes, after which we will ask questions and request changes to be made, which we expect to be done during the call.
 
Navigate to Rangr Data Applicant Projects (Gaining access is described at the bottom of this email) and open up your folder which is the same as your username to get started!
