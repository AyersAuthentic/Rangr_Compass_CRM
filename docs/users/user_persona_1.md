### Bio

Alex is a successful and ambitious Account Executive. He excels at building strong relationships with clients but struggles with the administrative side of his job. His current "system" is a chaotic mix of spreadsheets, a physical notebook, and his email inbox. He knows he's leaving money on the table because his follow-ups aren't as systematic as they should be. He finds enterprise CRM software like Salesforce to be too slow and complex for his needs; he just wants a simple, fast tool that helps him keep track of who he's talking to and what they talked about.

### Goals

* To quickly see a complete list of all known contacts at a company before making a call.
* To maintain a simple, chronological log of his interactions (calls, meetings) with each contact.
* To spend less than 30 seconds adding a new contact he just met.
* To spend more time selling and less time fighting with spreadsheets.

### Frustrations

* **"My notes are scattered."** He wastes time searching for information. "I know I spoke to someone from that company last week, but I can't remember who or what we discussed."
* **"Our main CRM is a battleship."** He feels that using the company's official CRM is like "using a battleship to cross a stream." It's too slow and has dozens of required fields he doesn't need.
* **"I lose context."** Without a central view, he sometimes forgets the names of key decision-makers or influencers within an account, which looks unprofessional.
* **"Data entry feels like a chore."** He hates administrative tasks and will avoid any tool that makes him feel like a data entry clerk.
