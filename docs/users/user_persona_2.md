# User Persona: Jordan Martinez

## Role & Context
**Title:** Business Development Representative  
**Company:** Mid-sized B2B technology consulting firm  
**Experience:** 3 years in sales  
**Territory:** West Coast companies (Technology, Healthcare, Hospitality, Manufacturing, Retail)  
**Portfolio Size:** 100 active customer accounts, 503 contacts  

---

## The Challenge

Jordan manages relationships with 100 companies across 5 different industries, averaging 5 contacts per company. Their day involves:

- **Prospecting:** Identifying which companies to prioritize based on revenue potential and industry
- **Relationship Management:** Tracking multiple contacts at each company (decision-makers, influencers, end-users)
- **Context Switching:** Moving between companies throughout the day while maintaining relationship context
- **Growth Opportunities:** Finding companies with fewer contacts where they could expand relationships

### Current Pain Points

**"I spend 30 minutes every morning just figuring out who I need to call"**
- Contact information scattered across spreadsheets, email, and notes
- No easy way to see all contacts at a company in one view
- Can't quickly filter by industry when headquarters asks for "Healthcare pipeline update"
- Loses context about who does what at each company

**"I've called the wrong person at a company because I forgot we had a better contact there"**
- No visibility into relationship hierarchy at each company
- Doesn't know if they have 1 contact or 5 at a given company
- Can't see contact roles/titles without opening multiple files

**"Adding new contacts is a chore, so I delay it and then forget details"**
- Manual data entry into spreadsheets is error-prone
- Easy to forget to link new contacts to the right company
- No standardized process for capturing contact information

**"I can't answer basic questions like 'How many contacts do we have in Healthcare?'"**
- No way to segment or filter contacts by company attributes
- Can't identify patterns or opportunities in their portfolio
- Reporting to management requires hours of manual work

## A Day in Jordan's Life (Without Rangr Compass CRM)

**8:00 AM:** Opens three different spreadsheets to compile today's call list  
**8:30 AM:** Realizes they don't have phone number for a key contact, searches email  
**10:15 AM:** Meets a new contact at Jackson Ltd, adds to mental "to-do" to update spreadsheet later  
**11:00 AM:** Manager asks "How many contacts do we have in Healthcare?" - starts manual counting  
**2:00 PM:** Calls someone at Torres Ltd, discovers they already have a VP-level contact there they should have called instead  
**4:00 PM:** Finally gets around to adding this morning's new contacts, can't remember the person's exact title  
**5:30 PM:** Still trying to answer manager's question from this morning  

**Result:** Frustrated, inefficient, missing opportunities

## A Day in Jordan's Life (With Rangr Compass CRM)

**8:00 AM:** Opens Rangr Compass CRM, filters companies by "needs follow-up this week", sees all contacts instantly  
**8:05 AM:** Has prioritized call list with phone numbers and context  
**10:15 AM:** Meets new contact at Jackson Ltd, adds them via Rangr Compass CRM's "Add Contact" action in 30 seconds  
**11:00 AM:** Manager asks "How many contacts in Healthcare?" - applies Industry filter, answers in 10 seconds  
**2:00 PM:** Before calling Torres Ltd, reviews company detail page, sees all contacts and their titles, calls the VP  
**4:00 PM:** All contacts from today already logged and properly linked  
**5:00 PM:** Leaves work on time, feels in control of their portfolio  

**Result:** Confident, efficient, maximizing relationship value

## Key Insights for Rangr Compass CRM Design

### What Jordan Values Most
1. **Speed** - Every click should save time, not add friction
2. **Context** - Never show data without the "why it matters"
3. **Simplicity** - Complex features won't be used; simple ones will be used daily
4. **Reliability** - If data is wrong, trust is broken forever

### What Jordan Will Actually Use
✅ **Company list with filters** - Uses daily for planning  
✅ **Company detail view** - Uses multiple times per day before calls  
✅ **Quick-add contact** - Uses whenever meeting new people  
✅ **Search by name** - Uses when customer calls unexpectedly  

### What Jordan Won't Use
❌ **Complex dashboards** - Too much cognitive load  
❌ **Advanced analytics** - Nice to have, not daily need  
❌ **Customization options** - Just wants it to work  

### Design Implications

**Company List View Must Show:**
- Company name (clickable)
- Industry (for mental context)
- Revenue (signals account priority)
- Contact count (shows relationship depth)
- Quick actions (don't make Jordan navigate away)

**Company Detail View Must Show:**
- Company info prominently (name, industry, revenue, website, address)
- ALL contacts at that company in a scannable table
- Contact details (name, title, email, phone)
- Clear "Add Contact" button

**Add Contact Action Must:**
- Pre-fill company if coming from company detail page
- Provide dropdown of all companies if adding from scratch
- Require minimal fields (name, email, phone, company)
- Show immediate feedback that contact was added

## Quote That Drives the Design

> "I don't need a complicated CRM. I need to know who to call, how to reach them, and what company they're at. If Rangr Compass CRM can do those three things faster than my current spreadsheet chaos, I'll use it every single day."

> **— Jordan Martinez, Business Development Representative**

## How to Use This Persona

### During Development:
**Ask yourself:** "Does this feature help Jordan call the right person faster?"
- If YES → Build it
- If NO → Cut it

### During Demo:
**Lead with Jordan's pain:** "Meet Jordan, who manages 100 companies and 503 contacts..."  
**Show the solution:** "Here's how Rangr Compass CRM solves Jordan's daily challenges..."  
**Quantify the impact:** "This saves Jordan 25 minutes every morning..."

### During Q&A:
**Ground answers in Jordan's reality:**
- "I chose this layout because Jordan needs to scan companies quickly..."
- "I prioritized this action because Jordan adds contacts multiple times per day..."
- "I didn't build X because it doesn't solve Jordan's core problem..."

## The Bottom Line

**Jordan represents the 80/20 rule:**
- 80% of CRM value comes from 20% of features
- Those 20% are: viewing companies, viewing contacts, adding contacts
- Everything else is nice-to-have

**Build for Jordan = Build a CRM people will actually use.**
